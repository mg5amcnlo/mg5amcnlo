<h2>Implementing an external ME+PS combination scheme and interfacing this 
plugin with Pythia</h2> 
 
For experts and developers of new matching/merging schemes, Pythia also offers 
the possibility to completely replace its internal merging machinery with 
a user-defined plugin code (much in the same way that parton shower plugins 
(cf. <a href="ImplementNewShowers.html" target="page">Implement New Showers</a>) are 
possible). This allows for maximum flexibility while still benefiting from 
the full Pythia event generation machinery. Note that the ME+PS merging with 
the VINCIA and DIRE shower plugins make use of this flexibility, and might 
thus provide helpful clarifications. 
 
Of course, implementing your 
own, new matching/merging scheme is a non-trivial task, and comprehensive 
guidelines on how to proceed are impossible to set. However, it is important 
that an external matching/merging plugin interfaces to Pythia in a simple and 
well-defined manner. Here, we will document which C++ functions are necessary 
to be able to use an external matching/merging (MM) plugin within Pythia. 
 
<p/> 
To understand how to design a MM plugin for Pythia, it is useful to review 
how Pythia's internal merging machinery is structured. The interaction between 
the core Pythia and the merging code is governed by the 
<code>Merging</code> and <code>MergingHooks</code> classes. Note that for 
moderately complex requirements, it may be sufficient to only replace Pythia's 
instance of <code>MergingHooks</code> with a pointer to an external class (cf. 
<a href="CKKWLMerging.html" target="page">CKKW-L merging</a>). The latter two classes 
are supplemented with the helper classes <code>History</code> and 
<code>HardProcess</code>. The latter gathers information on the (user-supplied 
information about the) hard core scattering process to which hard jets are 
added 
by ME+PS merging. It is only used as a helper to the <code>MergingHooks</code> 
class. The <code>History</code> class contains the implementation of all 
internal (LO or NLO) merging schemes. The <code>Merging</code> class 
acts as a bridge between the implementation in the <code>History</code> class 
and the rest of the Pythia code. 
 
<p/> 
To implement an external MM plugin, you will have to write classes that derive 
from the <code>Merging</code>, <code>MergingHooks</code> and 
<code>HardProcess</code> classes of Pythia. For special cases, it might also 
be permissible to only implement a replacement of the <code>Merging</code> 
class, while still using Pythia's implementation of the other two classes. 
 
The external MM plugin can then be transferred to and 
used by Pythia much in the same way as <code>UserHooks</code> classes or 
shower plugins. More concretely, an external MM code will 
be used if a pointer to an instance of the external classes is transferred to 
Pythia via the methods 
 
<a name="anchor1"></a>
<p/><strong> Pythia::setMergingPtr( Merging* myMerging) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
 
<a name="anchor2"></a>
<p/><strong> Pythia::setMergingHooksPtr( MergingHooks* myMergingHooks) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
 
<a name="anchor3"></a>
<p/><strong> MergingHooks::setHardProcessPtr( HardProcess* myHardProcess) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
 
<p/> 
The option to only use a user-defined <code>MergingHooks</code> instance is 
already documented in the item <a href="CKKWLMerging.html" target="page">CKKW-L merging</a> 
and will not be discussed further. We will now focus on how to implement 
external <code>Merging</code>, <code>MergingHooks</code> and 
<code>HardProcess</code> classes that can be used as a complete 
replacement of the Pythia methods. 
 
Let us assume that you want to create a class of type <code>MyMerging</code>, 
and you call its instance <code>myMerging</code>. For this external ME+PS 
merging class to be interfaced to Pythia, the class needs to inherit from the 
<code>Pythia8::Merging</code> base class. It is further necessary to define 
the following functions that serve as interface to Pythia: 
 
<a name="anchor4"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual ~MyMerging() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
A destructor for your ME+PS class. If not defined, the base class's empty 
destructor will be used. 
   
 
<a name="anchor5"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual void MyMerging::init() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
A method that is used to initialize your merging class. Pythia will call 
this function during its initialization and after all pointers to 
internal classes (e.g. to instances of the <code>Info</code> and 
<code>ParticleData</code> classes) have been set up. 
   
 
<a name="anchor6"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual void MyMerging::statistics() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function can be used to collect and print merging information at the 
end of the event generation. Pythia will call this function in the execution 
of a <code>Pythia::stat()</code> call. 
   
 
<a name="anchor7"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual int MyMerging::mergeProcess( Event& process) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function should be the main interface of Pythia to the MM plugin. 
Pythia will execute this function once the partonic (fixed-order) scattering 
has been constructed (or read from LHEF). The partonic scattering is 
transferred via the <code>process</code> argument. The external MM plugin 
should then, based on the <code>process</code>, implement the matching/merging 
strategy. It is permissible that this function changes <code>process</code>. 
In this case, Pythia will continue the event generation with the changed 
<code>process</code> as starting point. The return value of the function 
steers how Pythia should proceed after the function execution. The following 
return values are supported: 
<li> -1 : Reject the event and exit the generation/processing of the current 
event </li> 
<li>   0: Reject the event but continue with the generation/processing of the 
current event.</li> 
<li>   1: Keep the event but continue with the generation/processing of the 
current event.</li> 
<li>   2: Reject the event but continue with the generation/processing of the 
   current event. However, re-evaluate resonance decays before any other 
   event generation step. This option can be necessary if the merging code 
   removes or changes resonant particles from <code>process</code>.</li> 
 
Note that because this function is the main interface between the MM plugin 
and Pythia, it is necessary to use this function to set up all the information 
that you might later need (merging weights, particle counters, etc) in this 
call already. 
   
 
<p/> 
For more details on how to design your <code>MyMerging</code> class, and to 
understand the interface to Pythia, studying Pythia's internal code is 
unavoidable. Each potential developer of a MM plugin should do so. 
 
<p/> 
The other main ingredient of the interface to MM plugins is a new 
implementation 
of the <code>MergingHooks</code> class. Let us assume that you want to 
create a class of type <code>MyMergingHooks</code>, and you call its 
instance <code>myMergingHooks</code>. For this class to be interfaced to 
Pythia, it will need to inherit from the <code>Pythia8::MergingHooks</code> 
base class. 
 
<a name="anchor8"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual ~MyMergingHooks() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
A destructor for your MergingHooks class. If not defined, the base class's 
empty destructor will be used. 
   
 
<a name="anchor9"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual void MyMergingHooks::init() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
A method that is used to initialize your <code>MyMergingHooks</code> class. 
Pythia will call this function during its initialization and after all 
pointers to internal classes (e.g. to instances of the <code>Info</code> and 
<code>ParticleData</code> classes) have been set up. 
   
 
<a name="anchor10"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyMergingHooks::canVetoStep() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function will be used to tell Pythia if a CKKW-L-style event veto 
after the first parton shower emission should be checked. If so, the function 
should return true, and false otherwise. 
   
 
<a name="anchor11"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyMergingHooks::doVetoStep( const Event& process, const Event& event, bool doResonance = false ) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function will be used to implement the check of a CKKW-L-style event veto 
after the first parton shower emission, i.e. to check if the first parton 
shower emission is above the merging scale. 
If the input event <code>event</code> 
after emission should be kept, then false should be returned. If you want 
instead to veto the event and continue with a completely now hard scattering 
event, true should be returned. 
   
 
<a name="anchor12"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyMergingHooks::canVetoEmission() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function will be used to tell Pythia if a veto of emissions should 
potentially be applied. 
   
 
<a name="anchor13"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyMergingHooks::doVetoStep( const Event& event) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function will be used to implement the check if shower emissions should 
be discarded, as e.g. necessary in UMEPS or UNLOPS merging. 
You can study the input event <code>event</code> after emission, and return 
true if the emission is valid, and false if you want to reject the emission. 
Note that this veto does not lead to event rejections, only in potentially 
removing certain emissions during shower evolution. 
   
 
<a name="anchor14"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyMergingHooks::setShowerStartingScales( bool     isTrial, bool doMergeFirstEmm,     double& pTscaleIn, const Event& event,     double& pTmaxFSRIn, bool& limitPTmaxFSRin,     double& pTmaxISRIn, bool& limitPTmaxISRin,     double& pTmaxMPIIn, bool& limitPTmaxMPIin ) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function allows to set the starting scales for timelike and spacelike 
showering as well as multiparton interactions. It is thus necessary to 
properly start trial showers (that generate necessary no-emission 
probabilities), and for setting the correct starting conditions for parton 
showering of accepted (non-zero weight) events. 
The input <code>event</code> gives the hard process before showers and MPI 
are attempted. 
If <code>isTrial=true</code>, this means that the function is currently called 
from within a trial shower object (to produce no-emission probabilities). If 
<code>doMergeFirstEmm=true</code>, then the function is called to set starting 
conditions for the shower evolution of an (accepted) event. The double 
arguments <code>pTscaleIn</code>, <code>pTmaxFSRIn</code>, 
<code>pTmaxISRIn</code> and <code>pTmaxMPIIn</code> are tentative values 
for the starting scales of FSR, ISR and MPI. The function may overwrite 
these with the desired values. Similarly, <code>limitPTmaxFSRin</code>, 
<code>limitPTmaxFSRin</code> and <code>limitPTmaxMPIin</code> inform Pythia 
if the phase space for FSR/ISR/MPI is restricted (true) or unrestricted 
(false). Again, the tentative values can be overwritten. 
   
 
<p/> 
The <code>MergingHooks</code> base class allows for further virtual functions 
that are not directly called by Pythia, and are hence 
not necessary to define. Th usage of these functions within 
Pythia's <code>Merging</code> and <code>History</code> classes is documented 
in <a href="CKKWLMerging.html" target="page">CKKW-L merging</a>. The additional (optional) 
virtual functions are: 
 
<a name="anchor15"></a>
<p/><strong>   virtual double dampenIfFailCuts( const Event& inEvent ) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
<a name="anchor16"></a>
<p/><strong>   virtual bool canCutOnRecState() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
<a name="anchor17"></a>
<p/><strong>   virtual bool doCutOnRecState( const Event& event ) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
<a name="anchor18"></a>
<p/><strong>   virtual bool canVetoTrialEmission() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
<a name="anchor19"></a>
<p/><strong>   virtual bool doVetoTrialEmission( const Event&, const Event& ) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
<a name="anchor20"></a>
<p/><strong>   virtual double hardProcessME( const Event& inEvent ) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
<a name="anchor21"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual double tmsDefinition( const Event& event) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
<a name="anchor22"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual int getNumberOfClusteringSteps(const Event& event, bool resetNjetMax = false) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
<a name="anchor23"></a>
<p/><strong>   virtual bool useShowerPlugin() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
   
 
<p/> 
The internal implementation of <code>MergingHooks</code> in Pythia heavily 
relies on the <code>HardProcess</code> helper class. It is in principle 
not necessary to follow the same strategy when implementing a derived 
<code>MyMergingHooks</code> class. However, to benefit from the Pythia 
implementation, and to allow for a structure similar to the internal code also 
for an external MM plugin, it is also possible to effectively replace (in the 
<code>MergingHooks</code> class) the pointer to an instance of 
<code>HardProcess</code> with a pointer to an external implementation. 
Let us assume that you want to create a class of type 
<code>MyHardProcess</code>, and you call its instance 
<code>myHardProcess</code>. For this class to be interfaced to 
<code>MergingHooks</code> (or the derived <code>MyMergingHooks</code> class), 
it will need to inherit from the <code>Pythia8::HardProcess</code> base class. 
 
<a name="anchor24"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual ~MyHardProcess() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
A destructor for your HardProcess class. If not defined, the base class's 
empty destructor will be used. 
   
 
<a name="anchor25"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual void MyHardProcess::initOnProcess( string process, ParticleData* particleData) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function can be used to initialize the instance of your HardProcess 
class. In the internal Pythia implementation, this acts as a wrapper around 
the next function. 
   
 
<a name="anchor26"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual void MyHardProcess::translateProcessString( string process) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function will use the string argument to set up the hard process 
bookkeeping, e.g. how many incoming/outgoing particles of which flavour are 
contained in the core (lowest multiplicity) scattering process. 
   
 
<a name="anchor27"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual void MyHardProcess::storeCandidates( const Event& event, string process) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function studies the input event and book-keeps the particles that 
may be considered as part of the core scattering process. For this, it may 
use the four next functions. 
   
 
<a name="anchor28"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyHardProcess::allowCandidates(int iPos, vector&lt;int&gt; Pos1, vector&lt;int&gt; Pos2, const Event& event) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function uses the input vectors of positions of particles in the input 
event to decide if the particle with <code>iPos</code> could be member 
of the core scattering. If the particle with position <code>iPos</code> 
cannot be part of the core scattering (e.g. because it is a final state 
parton, while the core scattering contains final state leptons only), then 
the function should return false. Else, return true to allow this candidate. 
Note that it might be possible to find multiple equally good core scattering 
candidates. In this case, all candidates should be found (with the 
<code>findOtherCandidates</code> function), and can be potentially be 
replaced (with <code>exchangeCandidates</code>). 
   
 
<a name="anchor29"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyHardProcess::matchesAnyOutgoing(int iPos, const Event& event) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function may be used to check if the particle with position 
<code>iPos</code> in the input event should be considered an outgoing particle 
of the core scattering. 
   
 
<a name="anchor30"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyHardProcess::findOtherCandidates(int iPos, const Event& event, bool doReplace) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
The argument <code>iPos</code> specifies the position of a particle in the 
input event which is tagged as part of the core scattering. This function may 
be used to check the role of <code>iPos</code> as  core scattering member may 
be filled by another particle in the event record. If so, and if 
<code>doReplace=true</code>, then <code>iPos</code> will no longer be 
book-kept as part of the core scattering. An example where this functionality 
is helpful is if the input event is g g -> b b~ b  b~, and the core scattering 
is g g -> b b~. Not swapping the hard process candidates could in this case 
mean that not all parton shower histories can be found. 
The function should return false if no replacements can be found, and true 
otherwise. 
   
 
<a name="anchor31"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual bool MyHardProcess::exchangeCandidates( vector&lt;int&gt; candidates1, vector&lt;int&gt; candidates2, map&lt;int, int&gt; further1, map&lt;int, int&gt; further2) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This function implements the replacement of a list of core scattering 
candidates by another list of candidates.
