<h2>Resources for New Users</h2> 
 
<p>For a new user, getting started using an event generator can be a 
daunting task.  PYTHIA attemts to describe all parts of high-energy 
collisions between several species of fundamental and composite 
particles, and must by definition contain many settings and 
possibilities, which are not neccesarily interesting or useful to a 
new user.</p> 
 
<p>PYTHIA therefore ships with several example programs, each 
highlighting one, or a few, aspects of the framework. All example 
programs are located in the <code>examples/</code> subdirectory, along 
with instructions on how to be run.</p> 
 
<p>A new user who is already familar with other event generators, 
might want to start reading through the description of the 
<a href="ProgramFlow.html" target="page">Program Flow</a>, and then proceed to browse 
through the <a href="ExampleKeywords.html" target="page">Example Main Programs</a>, 
to find the physics aspects the user desires to study.</p> 
 
<p>For completely new users, the separate 
<a href="../pdfdoc/worksheet8200.pdf" target="page"> 
PYTHIA 8.2 Worksheet</a>, offers a more suitable practical introduction.</p>
