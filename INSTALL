Dependencies :
===============

 * MadGraph5_aMC@NLO *

- Python 2.6 (or higher, but not compatible with 3.X)

 * MadEvent *
Package for the LO cross-section computation and generation of events 

- bash
- perl 5.8 (or higher)
- a Fortran 77 compiler (such as g77 or gfortran)

 * aMC@NLO *
Package for the NLO cross-section computation (matched to shower) and generation of events 

- bash
- gfortran4.6 (or higher)
- fastjet
To configure the path to fastjet please do:
./bin/mg5
set fastjet PATH_TO_FASTJET-CONFIG_FILE


On Windows:
===========

In order to run MG5 you need to
1) add the Python directory to the PATH
2) run $> python ./bin/mg5

Note that most of the output (including madevent/aMCatNLO)
are not compatible with Windows even with cygwin.
