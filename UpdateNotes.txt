Update notes for MadGraph 5 (in reverse time order)

1.3.18 (04/10/11) JA: Use model information to determine color of particles
                      for reweighting and propagator color info.
                  JA: Changed the definition of "forbidden s-channels"
                      denoted by "$" to exclude on-shell s-channels while
                      keeping all diagrams (i.e., complemetary to the decay
                      chain formalism). This reduces the problems with 
                      gauge invariance compared to previously.
                      "Onshell" is as usual defined by the "bwcutoff" flag 
                      in the run_card.dat.
                  JA: Enable proper 4-flavor matching (such as gg>hbb~+jets)
                      Note that you need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.9 or 
                      later to use with 4F matching.
                      Changes include: alpha_s reweighting also for b vertices,
                      new scale treatment (mu_F for pp>hbb~ is (pT_b^max*m_Th)),
                      no clustering of gluons to final-state massive particles
                      in MadEvent.
		  JA: Ensure that factorization scale settings and matching works
                      also in singlet t-channel exchange processes like
                      single top and VBF. The dynamic factorization
                      scale is given by the pT of the scattered quark
                      (on each side of the event).
                      Note: Note that you need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.10 
                      or later to use with VBF matching, to ensure that both
                      radiated and scattered partons are treated correctly
                      - scattered partons need to be excluded from the matching,
                      since their pT can be below QCUT. An even better
                      treatment would require to individually shower and match
                      the two sides in Pythia, which is not presently possible.
                  JA: Fixed pdf reweighting for matching, which due to a mistake
                      had never been activated
                  JA: Improved phase space integration presetting further by 
                      taking into account special cuts like xpt, ht etc.
                  JA: Introduce new convention for invariant mass cuts
                      - if max < min, exclude intermediate range
                      (allows to exclude W/Z dijet resonances in VBF processes)

1.3.17 (30/09/11) OM: Fix a crash created by ALOHA when it tries to create the full
                      set of ALOHA routines (pythia8 output only).

1.3.16 (11/09/11) JA: Fixed the problem from 1.3.12.

1.3.15 (09/09/11) OM: remove the fix of 1.3.12
                      (No events in output for some given processes)

1.3.14 (08/09/11) OM: Fix a bug in the RS model introduced in 1.3.8

1.3.13 (05/09/11) JA: Fixed bug with cut_decays=F which removed cuts also for
                      non-decay products in certain channels if there is
                      a forced decay present. Note that this does not affect
                      xqcut, only pt, minv and eta cuts.
                  JA: If non-zero phase space cutoff, don't use minimum of
                      1 GeV (this allows to go to e.g. 2m_e invariant mass for
                      \gamma* > e+ e-).

1.3.12 (01/09/11) JA: Fixed problem with decay chains when different decays
                      result in identical final states, such as
                      p p > go go, (go > b1/b1~ b/b~, b1/b1~ > b/b~ n1)
		      (only one of the decay chains was chosen, instead of
                      all 3 combinations (b1,b1), (b1,b1~), (b1~,b1~))
                  JA: Allow for overall orders also with grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Ensure that only leading color flows are included in event
                      output (so no singlet flows from color octets).
                  JA: Fixed small bug in fermion flow determination for multifermion
                      vertices.

1.3.11 (26/08/11) JA: Improved precision of "survey" by allowing 4th and 5th 
                      iteration if accuracy after 3 iterations < 10%.
                  JA: Subdivide BW in phase space integration for conflicting BWs 
                      also for forced decays, to improve generation with large
                      bwcutoff in e.g. W+ W- production with decays.
                  JA: Do refine using luminocity instead of number of events,
                      to work with badly determined channels.
                  JA: Don't use BW for shat if mass > sqrt(s).
                  JA: Fixed insertion of colors for octet resonances decaying to 
                      octet+singlet (thanks Bogdan for finding this)

1.3.10 (23/08/11) OM: Update ALOHA version
                  OM: increase waiting time for jobs to write physically the results on
                      the disks (in ordre to reduce trouble on the cluster).

1.3.9 (01/08/11)  OM: Add a new model DY_SM (arXiv:1107.5830). Thanks to Neil
                      for the generation of the model 

1.3.8 (25/07/11)  JA: Replace the SM and HEFT models with latest versions using
                      the Wolfenstein parameterization for the CKM matrix.
                  JA: Implemented reading of the new UFO information about
                      coupling orders (order hierarchy and expansion_order).
                  JA: New "coupling order" specification WEIGHTED which checks
                      for  sum of coupling orders weighted by their hierarchy.
                  JA: Implemented optimal coupling orders for processes from any
                      model if no coupling orders specified.

1.3.7 (21/07/11)  JA: Fix makefiles for some v4 models that were forgotten
                      in v. 1.3.5

1.3.6 (18/07/11)  OM: Ensure that the new makefiles work on the web

1.3.5 (14/07/11): JA: New organization of make files, ensure that compilation works 
                      for all modes (with/without LHAPDF, static/dynamic, 
                      regular/gridpack) for both Linux and Mac OS X (be careful with 
                      dynamic libraries on Mac OS X though, since it seems that 
                      common blocks might not work properly)
                  JA: Fixed proper error messages and clean stop for compilation 
                      errors during MadEvent run.

1.3.4 (05/07/11): OM: More informative error message when a compilation error occurs

                      no 3-vertex-only diagrams
                  JA (by OM): More informative error when trying to generate invalid 
                      pythia8 process

1.3.2 (14/06/11): OM: Fix fortran output when a model is case sensitive 
      		      (Bug if a coupling was depending of a case sensitive parameter)
                  SdV: Remove a annoying print in the new cuts (added in 1.3.0)
		  OM: Fix a compilation problem in the standalone cpp output

                      diagrams for crossed processes
                  JA: Automatic optimization of order of particles in
                      multiparticle labels for optimal multiprocess generation
                  JA: Improved efficiency of identification of identical
                      matrix elements
                  JA: Improved identification of diagrams with identical
                      divergency structure for grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Included more fine-grained run options in the
                      run_card, including helicity summation options,
                      whether or not to set ptj and mjj automatically
                      based on xqcut, etc.
                  JA: Fixed some minor array limit and arithmetics warnings
                      for extreme decay and decay chain processes.
                  SdV: Added cuts on H_T(all jets, light and b)
                  OM: Fixed minor bug related to cluster option in launch

1.2.4 (15/05/11): JA: Fixed long-standing bug in DECAY relating to
                      the cross section info in <init> block, and
                      fixed parameter reading for MG5 SM model.

1.2.3 (11/05/11): JA: Fixed problem with scale choice in processes with mixed 
                      QED/QCD orders, e.g. p p > t t~ QED=2. Note that this fix
                      doesn't work for p p > t t~ j j QED=4 which should still
                      be avoided.
		  JA: Added the ptllmin/max options in the default run_card.dat

                      the user interface.
                  OM: minor fixes related to checking the gauge

1.1.0 (21/04/11): JA: Removed hard limit on number of external particles in 
                      MadEvent, allowing for unlimited length decay chains there
                      (up to 14 final state particles successfully integrated).
                  JA: Improved helicity selection and automatic full helicity 
                      sum if needed. Optimization of run parameters.
                  JA: New flag in run_card.dat to decide whether basic cuts
                      are applied to decay products or not.
                  OM: Merged ALOHA calls for different lorentz structures 
                      with the same color structures, increasing the speed and 
                      efficiency of matrix element evaluations.
                  OM: Added new "open" command in command line interface,
